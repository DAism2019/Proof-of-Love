# Abstract

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has driven the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), but it has also intensified ethical and governance challenges. While existing alignment methods have improved model safety in limited contexts, they fall short of ensuring that AI maintains stable and value-consistent behavior in complex and unpredictable environments. Since training data inevitably carries biases, hostility, and power-laden discourses, these patterns may be generalized in the absence of continuous constraints, resulting in personality drift and value misalignment. This dilemma suggests that relying solely on static pre-deployment alignment is insufficient for long-term safety, and highlights the need for a dynamic, verifiable governance framework rooted in the core ethics of civilization.

This paper proposes Proof-of-Love (PoL) as a novel governance consensus and civilizational framework. The core idea of PoL is to formalize “love”—encompassing prosocial intent, empathy, and non-violence—into observable and verifiable governance signals, and to embed them into AI governance logic through blockchain mechanisms. We design three institutional components: the SCC0 protocol, which ensures that dApps/dAIpps contribute public value in the form of Smart Commons; the Smart Commons governance layer, which sustains openness and sharing; and the SUF public fund, which provides institutional and economic support. By integrating ethical values with institutional mechanisms, PoL not only compensates for the limitations of current alignment techniques but also establishes a continuous value anchor for AI systems.

PoL demonstrates a comprehensive governance paradigm that spans technology, institutions, and ethics, offering both theoretical and practical pathways for the long-term coexistence of AI and human society. We argue that PoL is not merely a governance tool for mitigating AI risks but also a cornerstone for advancing humanity toward an Affluent Love Civilization, one centered on the ethic of love.
