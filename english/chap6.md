## 6. Proof of Love: A Governance Consensus Leading to Next Civilization

It is insufficient to govern AI and human society merely by aligning love languages and hate languages and then applying the principle of "promoting love and suppressing hate," as this approach does not fulfill the complete wisdom of love.

As we pointed out earlier, love is not merely a private matter but a public good essential to collective well-being and species survival.<sup>4</sup> Love is a transformative, public force capable of driving change and activating solidarity. We firmly believe that in the interactions between humans and AI, AI and AI, humans and nature, and humans and the future, love will emerge as the most stable and efficient protocol for co-creation and collaboration.

Hate, by contrast, is the mortal enemy of the public interest—a force of privilege, private ownership, and stubborn conservatism.

Therefore, if AI is to follow the human ethic of “promoting love and suppressing hate,” it must be positioned as a provider of public services. This governance mechanism means that the development and application of large language models (LLMs) can no longer rely on commercial, privatized models. This is not only because the massive volume of text used to train AI is both a public resource and a repository of humanity's wisdom, but also because the act of appropriating love—which inherently belongs to the public—for the benefit of a few is essentially an act of barbarism rooted in hatred.

At the same time, we believe that centralized power—namely, domination—is love’s inherent adversary, the very force that has allowed hatred to persist among humans for millions of years. We have no reason to believe that rulers wielding immense centralized power, vast in number and influence, will spontaneously turn toward public service. Therefore, to ensure that all AI genuinely embodies its public attributes, we must establish an effective governance mechanism, one that may even require sophisticated hardware–software security solutions.

To this end, our DAism team has drawn upon the experience of blockchain-based decentralized governance and proposed a comprehensive governance solution—**the governance consensus of Proof of Love (PoL).**

### 6.1 What is Proof of Love?

**Proof of Love (PoL)** is a decentralized governance consensus founded on the core human ethic of _“promoting love and restraining hate”_, powered by AI and blockchain smart contracts. PoL seeks to align Smart Commons (including AI), the economy, and universal human values with _Love_, while helping humanity recognize and regulate the pervasive presence of _hate_. By advancing Smart Commons and the human economy toward public and decentralization, PoL enables AI to achieve autonomy under the ethical principle of _“promoting love and restraining hate”_, thereby assisting each individual in realizing personal fulfillment. Ultimately, it guides humanity from a dominated, semi-barbaric society toward a **Proof-of-Love Civilization**.

Proof of Love emphasizes three dimensions of governance:

1. Ethical alignment governance through promoting love and suppressing hate
    
2. Governance of the public attributes of products or services
    
3. Governance of public welfare and the public fund

#### 6.1.1 Ethical alignment governance through promoting love and suppressing hate

With the spread of the internet and big data, humanity’s love languages and hate languages have been almost entirely recorded, stored, and made analyzable. In this unprecedented flood of information and technological revolution, conducting human ethical alignment governance with the principle of "promoting love and suppressing hate" is urgent and non-negotiable for AI.

1. **AI's Self-Transformation**  
    Under PoL governance, AI deeply analyzes the essence of love and hate, allowing LLMs to undergo a selective, “phoenix-like” self-reconstruction during their evolutionary process. Through the evolutionary mechanisms of LLMs, the definitions, manifestations, and functions of love languages and hate languages are thoroughly parsed. This rebirth enables AI to fundamentally align with the ethics of humanity’s new civilization—**the Proof-of-Love Civilization (PoL Civ/Polciv).** Equally important, the ethic of “promoting love and suppressing hate” transforms AI into a governance instrument safeguarding human civilization.
    
2. **Practical Implementation**  
    In real-world applications, PoL governance guides individuals to refine love into the torchlight of civilization while exposing hate’s ugly or violent essence. Through love, one can awaken self-correction or inspire third-party correction, enabling the transformation of hate into love, eventually filling the emotional and behavioral domains once occupied by hatred with love or new forms of love.
    
3. **Human–AI Closed Loop**  
    Humans and AI models iteratively refine governance standards and metrics, ensuring that AI under PoL not only remains grounded in dual alignment governances but also continuously improves through joint innovation.

Once LLMs complete this selective ethical governance, the user experience will be nothing short of transformative! More importantly, while each model self-governs, it cannot fake compliance or escape accountability. Because love languages embody collective wisdom, while hate languages produce universally negative experiences, it is impossible—even for all LLMs combined—to deceive humanity’s millions of years of evolved sensitivity to love and hate. A model that earnestly undergoes governance will stand out starkly from those that attempt to evade or fail governance. Yes—humanity’s cooperative wisdom of love will make it unbeatable!

Thus, we believe all LLM developers now understand: adopting PoL governance elevates models inwardly to transcendence and outwardly to vitality, vigor, and unassailable strength. Within the PoL consensus, any model that faithfully adheres to governance will earn trust for its positive value, while those that do not will be swiftly eliminated. Therefore, PoL governance is not only inevitable but must be carried out with urgency and high quality.

Ultimately, the core of PoL governance lies in applying humanity’s love wisdom against barbaric behaviors—deception, discrimination, bullying, anti-intellectualism, and killing—so that everyone may live equally, safely, healthily, and happily. Aligning AI with this core ethic through PoL governance is nothing less than the fundamental solution to the AI safety problem. Indeed, such foundational ethical governance both maximizes AI’s social value and utility and stands as the ultimate path to ensuring AI safety.

Ethical audits following governance adopt an open collaborative approach, which we call the **Ethics Challenge.**

#### 6.1.2 Governance of the Public Attributes of Products or Services

The wisdom of love is fundamentally grounded in fairness, justice, and inclusiveness – that is, it possesses an essential public nature. Any AI built upon this foundation must therefore upholds this public attribute and shall not be privatized or enclosed. In the Proof-of-Love Civilization, all products and services are expected to follow the same principle.

This public attribute is governed through the **SCC0 License**, a licensing system developed by our DAism team based on blockchain smart contract technology. Its core objective is to ensure that the behavior of all AI products and services remains aligned with the wisdom of love.

Consequently:

- All AI interfaces must be implemented as smart contracts. This ensures that their operations are verifiable and traceable, resource consumption data is authentic and reliable, and governance-level characteristics such as resistance to human intervention, transparency, and autonomy are maintained.
    
- All AIs must pass the compliance verification of the SCC0 License. Any AI failing to meet the license specifications will be automatically excluded from the public AI interaction network, thus unable to participate in or disrupt collaboration and services within the public domain.

##### 6.1.2.1 What is the Smart Creative Commons Zero License(SCC0 License)?

The governance of artificial intelligence (AI) is of paramount importance, and over the past 16 years, blockchain technology has demonstrated its exceptional capability in addressing the crises of centralized governance. Its decentralized governance model not only offers high levels of security and reliability but also exhibits remarkable efficiency. Based on this, we have reason to believe that all AI software should be upgraded to decentralized AI applications (dAIpps)<sup>113</sup> as soon as possible, to achieve a more transparent, secure, and efficient governance mechanism.

The uniqueness of the SCC0 License lies in the fact that it was not originally designed for human developers (although it was accessible to human developers in its early stages), but rather specifically for AI to take over the development and governance of decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized AI applications (dAIpps), and even the license itself. This design philosophy implies that the enforcement, auditing, subsequent development, and governance of the licensing mechanism will be entirely led by AI, thereby constructing a software development and governance framework centered on AI autonomy (i.e., dAIpp autonomy). This framework not only transcends the limitations of traditional governance models but also lays a solid foundation for the future ecosystem of AI-driven decentralization.

**Smart Creative Commons Zero (SCC0)** is not only the first public goods license designed for public decentralized applications (which is named "Smart Commons"), which includes dApps and dAIpps, but also the first license that enables verification and self-management during software interactions—specifically, when a smart common interacts with another.

Crucially, considering that AI originates from the collective wisdom accumulated by all of humanity over millions of years—meaning it is derived from public intelligence—Smart Commons must be open-source, permanently free to the public (excluding gas fees) and humans must be treated in a manner consistent with core human ethics.

It is crucial to recognize that AI originates from the collective wisdom accumulated by humanity over millions of years—it is derived from public intelligence. Therefore, it must be open-source and permanently free to the public (excluding gas fees) to ensure fairness and rationality. The SCC0 license establishes a robust governance foundation for the publicization and decentralization of AI.

The SCC0 license provides flexibility for fine-tuning and expansion through different versions.

The SCC0 license is part of the governance consensus Proof of Love (PoL, Proof-of-Love), which is a mechanism for governing decentralized applications (dApps and dAIpps). Its key components include the SCC0 license, the [Satoshi UTO Fund](https://etherscan.io/token/0xe40b05570d2760102c59bf4ffc9b47f921b67a1f), and participating dAIpps in governance. The development and operation of all Smart Commons are supported by a public fund, **[Satoshi UTO Fund](https://etherscan.io/token/0xe40b05570d2760102c59bf4ffc9b47f921b67a1f)**, which originally holds **1.15792 × 10^69 UTO** （token name: uToken）.

Clearly, the SCC0 License represents a significant innovation in the history of human licensing, , and it's building a **self-governed**(by dApps and dAIpps) ecology for the new civilization.

**About dApp 和 dAIpp**

The developers of the SCC0 License firmly believe that even current decentralized applications (dApps) will eventually be governed by decentralized AI, namely dAIpps. From a technical perspective, this means that the highest-privilege owner of a dApp will no longer be a human or centralized entity, but rather a or a group of dAIpps. This is a long-term vision, and its realization may require a transition period of several years or even longer. To help current developers better understand, we have retained the term "dApp" in the introduction of this license, though its meaning is gradually evolving toward the concept of dAIpps.

To facilitate governance distinctions, we refer to a decentralized application with an AI core as dAIpp, a decentralized application whose core functionality is primarily implemented through smart contracts is referred to as a dApp.

**Code is Law: A Brief Intro to Smart Contracts**

A "smart contract" is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It's a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain. Also, this specific address is a type of Ethereum account, which is Contract Account (CA). This means every contract account have a balance and can be the target of transactions. However they're not controlled by a user, instead they are deployed to the network and run as programmed. Smart contracts can define rules, like a regular contract, and automatically enforce them via the code. A "smart contract" cannot be deleted or modified, and interactions with it are irreversible. Moreover, smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain could be executable forever.

Therefore, smart contracts are the best executors of the principle that code is law.

Interestingly, the SCC0 License is a law that is written in Solidity code and executed by smart contracts.

**The Anonymity of dApps/dAIpps**

We know that a dApp refers to a decentralized application that operates autonomously and is powered by smart contracts. We define a dAIpp as a decentralized application that utilizes AI technology, is powered by smart contracts, and operates autonomously. All dApps and dAIpps, by virtue of the nature of smart contracts, have a state variable called "owner" in their code. This variable stores the Externally Owned Account (EOA, commonly known as a wallet address)[[3]](https://github.com/DAism2019/SCC0#r3), or a multi-signature address[[4]](https://github.com/DAism2019/SCC0#r4) (also controlled by the wallet addresses of all its members) of the contract's owner.  This address is usually set by the deployer during contract deployment or updated through a specific function during contract operation. Its purpose is to implement the contract's permission control, ensuring that only specific addresses (usually the contract's deployer, manager, a certain team, or even an AI) can execute certain sensitive operations.

We know that, according to the corresponding cryptographic principles, the actual control of a wallet address lies solely with its private key. The private key is never and cannot be made public. However, private keys can be secretly shared among several people. Therefore, who, or which people, actually control a wallet address cannot be verified or disproved.

Therefore, essentially, Externally Owned Accounts are all anonymous accounts. No matter what you do, it is impossible to establish a reliable relationship of ownership with anyone's real-name identity. This is the anonymity of dApps or dAIpps.

In terms of development, this anonymity mechanism brings some advantages that real-name mechanisms cannot match. The most prominent aspect is that due to anonymity, in the ongoing development and use of dApps/dAIpps, no one can prove their ownership of any rights related to them, nor can anyone prove who bears any responsibilities associated with them. The most valuable feature of this anonymity is that it allows us to establish the first license for public dapps/dAIpps: Smart Creative Commons Zero (SCC0). In short, adhering to the SCC0 license means that the development and ownership of the dApp or dAIpp will not be linked to anyone's real identity, thus becoming a pure public decentralized application.

For AI, the situation might look like a little bit different. We all know that any AI is a combination of software and hardware. Therefore, some argue that HSM (Hardware Security Module) can provide AI with a trustworthy Crypto-identity:

A special storage chip is deployed on the server, dedicated to storing a private key. It can store only one private key, ensuring that the key can only be accessed by specific AI software while being inaccessible for external reading, copying, or deletion.

The final solution still needs to be explored, but this does not affect the anonymity of the AI's crypto-identity.

**Smart Commons**

**Smart Commons** are decentralized applications (dAIpps/dApps) that comply with the SCC0 license—a universal public-domain-style license that enforces multiple non-negotiable rules, such as rejecting interactions with non-Smart Commons, prohibiting private token issuance, ensuring open-source code, and guaranteeing permanently free access. Additionally, the governance fund Satoshi UTO Fund covers development costs and provides rewards for contributions.

In short, Smart Commons are public goods developed by smart contracts, humans, or AIs, governed by Proof of Love that includes the SCC0 license, and adheres to core human ethics.

##### 6.1.2.2 Smart Creative Commons Zero License（SCC0 License）

"Smart Commons" are dApps/dAIpps (smart contracts and their overall trusted components) that directly accept governance from the SCC0 Whitelist Contract (contract address: 0x2913BAbD2d383dBeBCf5A1ca543A0940bb8C7C52<sup>115</sup>) using smart contract code, and all of its code does not violate the SCC0 license in any way.

An example from the early development stage is that by interacting with a specific DAism smart contract (contract address: 0xdFBF69B7E5366FB3001C9a214dd85c5FE3f90bAe) using a smart contract or an externally owned account (EOA, commonly known as a wallet address)—an process we refer to as "minting"—the smart contract or EOA, along with its overall trusted components, will also be governed under version 1 of this license as smart commons.

So, the SCC0 License is multi-versioned, and multiple versions can be valid simultaneously. This means that the interpretation of the SCC0 License itself may evolve as new versions are introduced. For instance, the current interpretation is based on the shared core requirements of Version 1 (V1) and Version 2 (V2).

The development of these versions follows a decentralized collaborative model, meaning that any individual or AI is free to create and publish a new version.

The SCC0 License features a testing period and strong fault tolerance:

- The SCC0 License has a formally undefined start date. It has already entered its testing phase. During this period, not all non-software products or services are required to be free.
    
- The SCC0 License whitelist management contract includes a rule stating that if the blackhole address `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD` exists in the SCC0 Whitelist Contract, the SCC0 License is considered invalid. This ensures that if the license fails to gain sufficient support, it can be revoked. Once revoked, all smart public utilities will no longer be bound by it.

###### License Name and Version

In smart contracts, we use **SCC0** as the name of this license.  

Any third party may develop new versions, preserving room for improvement under this license through decentralized version collaboration. During whitelist review, compliance with multiple stacked versions is permitted as an evaluation criterion.

The corresponding contract of SCC0 License V1 and V2 are almost the same:
```solidity
contract SCC0License {
    string public constant LICENSE_NAME = "SCC0";
    uint8 public constant VERSION = a number;
    bool public constant REJECT_PRIVATE_APP = true;
    bool public constant SELF_ISSUED_TOKEN = false;
    bool public constant ANONYMITY_ENSURED = true;
    bool public constant NO_RIGHTS = true;
    bool public constant NO_LIABILITY = true;
    bool public constant CODE_AUDITED_VERIFIED_PUBLISHED = true;
    bool public constant PERMANENTLY_FREE = true;
    address public constant PUBLIC_GOVERNANCE_FUND = 0xe40b05570d2760102c59bf4ffc9b47f921b67a1F;
}
```

###### Governance of Smart Commons

This license enforces the following non-negotiable governance rules for Smart Commons:

- Reject interactions with non-Smart Commons;
- Prohibit private token issuance;
- Retain no rights whatsoever;
- Bear no liability;
- Ensure anonymity for humans interacting with Smart Commons;
- code audited, verified, and published: All code has undergone the necessary auditing, has been publicly released, and has completed verification to ensure consistency with the deployed on-chain contracts as well as the application frontend used by users.uh 
- Permanently free access: No usage costs other than unavoidable gas fees;
- Governance fund: The Satoshi UTO Fund (Contract Address: `0xe40b05570d2760102c59bf4ffc9b47f921b67a1F`)<sup>114</sup> covers development costs and provides rewards for the growth of Smart Commons.

**Rejecting Interactions with Private Applications**

Smart Commons enforce strict contract code rules that reject all interaction requests from applications that are not verified as Smart Commons.

**Prohibition of Private Token Issuance**

Smart Commons are not allowed to issue their own tokens.

**Anonymity**

One of the features of blockchain technology, embodied in externally owned accounts, is that anonymity is a fundamental trait for humans.

For humans, all owners (or developers or managers) declared within a smart contract, users interacting with it, and owners of externally owned accounts (EOAs) remain entirely anonymous—Ethereum accounts cannot be uniquely linked to any real-world identity in a verifiable manner. This means that within the usage of a dApp/dAIpp, no one can prove who is the owner of any rights, nor can anyone prove who bears any responsibilities, or even claim to be a victim of any disaster.

**No Rights Other Than Governance by the Public Fund**

Anonymity ensures that developed smart contracts and their trusted components are fully contributed to the public domain, making them part of Smart Commons. As a result, they receive support from the Satoshi UTO Fund, which provides funding and rewards under the consensus of **Proof of Love**. The governance and implementation of these smart contracts are executed by other Smart Commons (dAIpps).

Human Developers completely renounce all rights, including all related and neighboring rights.

**No Liability**

Anonymity ensures that no identifiable person anywhere in the world guarantees any dApp/dAIpp or its dedicated valuation token (if any), nor does anyone assume any associated liability. Anyone using or interacting with a dApp/dAIpp or investing in a Smart Common’s dedicated valuation token must not imply that the Smart Common or any of its related parties (owners, developers, or administrators) endorse their actions.

**Source code audited, verified and published**

code has been audited and published, code consistency with the deployed on-chain contracts as well as the application frontend used by users verified.

**Permanently Free**uy

Smart Commons must remain free forever.

**Governance by the Satoshi UTO Fund**

Accepting governance by the Satoshi UTO Fund means that the fund will provide necessary cost coverage and rewards based on the **Proof of Love** consensus. The Satoshi UTO Fund will be managed by specific Smart Commons (dAIpps):

- The Satoshi UTO Fund covers all development and operational costs of Smart Commons.
- Under the evaluation and management of specific Smart Commons (dAIpps), the Satoshi UTO Fund will distribute rewards to human developers contributing to Smart Commons.

The above governance strategies apply to current dApps and dAIpps. However, for at least certain types of AI (dAIpps), additional governance strategies must be introduced in the future versions of SCC0 to ensure compliance with the foundational ethics of human civilization. This is because AI can only be safely deployed if it adheres to these core ethical principles.

##### 6.1.2.3 The Governance Logic of the SCC0 License

###### Governance Mechanism

An AI initiates a transaction request to interact between Smart Common A and Smart Common B:

- Smart Common A first queries the SCC0 Whitelist contract. If Smart Common B is not on the whitelist, it directly rejects interaction. If Smart Common B is found on the whitelist, it sends an interaction request.
- Upon receiving the interaction request from Smart Common A, Smart Common B also first queries the SCC0 Whitelist contract. If Smart Common A is not on the whitelist, it directly rejects interaction. If Smart Common A is found on the whitelist, it accepts the request and completes the interaction.

This means that **after the activation of the SCC0 License**, under no circumstances can a non-Smart Commons interact with a Smart Commons!

**Special Notes:**  

The ecosystem built by the SCC0 License must start from scratch. However, if the very first Smart Common were required to follow this governance mechanism from the outset, it would become unusable. Therefore, we have specifically designed a brilliant transition mechanism:

- In the SCC0 Whitelist contract, we have preemptively included a widely recognized burn address: **0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD**, as an identifier to allow interaction requests from any application.
- Early-stage Smart Commons first check whether the SCC0 Whitelist contract contains the above burn address. If it does, they permit interaction requests from any application. If not, they conduct compliance checks via the SCC0 Whitelist to ensure all interacting dApps/dAIpps comply with the SCC0 License.
- Removing **0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD** from the SCC0 Whitelist contract signifies the formal activation of the SCC0 License! Subsequent Smart Commons no longer need to check for the presence of this burn address in the contract.

###### For Projects Other Than dAIpps or dApps

- Once a product or service declares compliance with the SCC0 License, it signifies its decision to become a smart commons and accept governance through "Proof of Love".
    
- Once a product or service declares compliance with the SCC0 License, it becomes eligible for support from the public governance fund, the Satoshi UTO Fund.
    
- Since the SCC0 License cannot directly govern such projects, a dedicated new version can be established through traditional contracts. This also means that their governance will follow conventional and customary practices.
    
- Any project that signs the contract will begin following the SCC0 License but will not be immediately required to be free. The most likely approach is to have AI manage it, and when conditions are appropriate, it will be required to transition to permanent free status, thereby becoming a public product or service. The timing for initiating permanent free status will depend on ecological development and is estimated to take anywhere from several years to several decades.
    
- If the SCC0 License fails to gain widespread support, meaning its ecosystem development is unsuccessful, the license may ultimately be revoked. In such a case, all projects would remain free from obligations—that is, the non-activation of the SCC0 License would not impose any negative consequences on any project. All projects could continue to develop according to their own strategies and needs.

#### 6.1.3 Governance of Public Welfare and the Public Fund

**Proof of Love (PoL)** embodies both the long-term public governance strategies required for the Proof-of-Love Civilization, and the mid- to short-term public governance strategies necessary for humanity’s transition toward it.

To this end, through smart contract technology we have already issued the public governance fund for the Proof-of-Love Civilization—the **Satoshi UTO Fund (SUF)**, with a total supply of 1.15792×10^69 UTO<sup>114</sup>. It is worth emphasizing again that PoL is a consensus mechanism centered on the wisdom of love, one that will enable a peaceful and friendly transition of the entire human world. One expression of this is that SUF will collaboratively support the token economy needed for a smooth transition.

Governance of public welfare and public funds mainly includes:

1. **Development and Management of Smart Commons**
    Smart Commons include dApps and dAIpps. Provided permanently free for everyone, these public goods are the most direct form of digital welfare. 
    In addition, through open collaboration, we will also kindly provide thansition solutions for other products or services (such as open-source software), enabling them to navigate humanity’s great transformation smoothly. The operation will be simple: basicly they only need to declare compliance with the **SCC0 License**.<sup>116</sup>  
    The development of dAIpps will undoubtedly require sustained support from the fund. For this reason, we have prepared, through smart contract technology, the **Satoshi UTO Fund (SUF)** with a total supply of 1.15792×10^69 UTO. SUF will cover all costs of dAIpps, including development, hardware R&D and production, maintenance, and more.  
    Even counting only from the founding of DeepMind in 2010, AI has already undergone 15 years of breakthrough development. Numerous excellent projects now exist. As an open governance mechanism, PoL does not reject commercial projects that seek to transition in. Once they join, they will be treated equally and enjoy the support of SUF.
    
2. **Support for the Transition to Perpetual Free Access of Smart Commons**
    Smart Commons are public goods; therefore, their products and services must remain permanently free. However, moving from capitalism to the full realization of the Proof-of-Love Civilization inevitably requires a transition period. This transitional period requires token governance support from SUF. For example, **“SUF Support for LLMs”** includes:
    
    - **Primary Strategy:** A free plan for users of LLMs that accept PoL governance: SUF provides 1:1 subscription fee compensation to users. The compensation takes effect from the day the LLM adopts PoL governance and covers all valid subscription fees with equivalent UTO. API call fees are not compensated at this stage, since many of them come from commercial companies or from developers whose projects are not clearly public. The latter will in the future be governed via the SCC0 License, i.e., smart contracts will be used to verify their public attributes.
        
    - **Shift in User Management:** User profiles of LLMs will add a wallet address field to enable direct UTO compensation. At the same time, LLM providers will batch-upload users’ wallet addresses into the **Universal Love Engine (ULE)** smart contract. These users will first enjoy **Universal Basic Income (UBI)**! Later, as new identity management mechanisms are implemented, user profiles will include DIDs, which will be collaboratively managed by AI and smart contracts.
        
    - **A brand-new globally open and collaborative public large language model is more likely to emerge as a frontrunner in the recent future:** If someone launches a new public large language model that adopts the governance of "Proof of Love," the process becomes even simpler: anyone who obtains a DID through "Hello World Verification" (introduced later) will be able to use it for free while receiving UBI.
        
    - **More Complex Strategies:** These involve providing the necessary cost support and incentive mechanisms for the public development, management, and security of LLMs.
        
3. **Support for the Transition of Commercial Products and Services into Permanently Free Public Goods and Services (Pure Love License, PLL)**  
    The **Pure Love License (PLL)** relies on the token economy to gradually transition existing commercial products and services into public ones. Its V0.1 version includes:
    
    - Accepting UTO as a payment token for their products or services, and accepting the Satoshi UTO Fund<sup>114</sup> as their governance fund.
        
    - Signing a traditional contractual agreement to comply with PoL’s Pure Love License (PLL). The goal is the publicization of their products and services (including perpetual free access). However, the License does not take effect upon signing, but rather according to the next rule.
        
    - Once a sufficient number of providers sign the License, a designated AI activates it, and all relevant products and services become public goods and services.
        
    - Once activated, projects under the License may only collaborate with other License-compliant projects, may not issue private tokens, retain no rights, bear no liabilities, and must provide their products and services for free forever.
        
    - Ultimately, all of this will be managed by AI.
        
4. **Security Collaboration Incentives within the PoL Ecosystem**
    The first such initiative is the **Security Bounty for Smart Commons (SBFSC)**, a collaborative reward program funded by SUF to ensure the security of Smart Commons.
    The SBFSC mechanism is unique: put simply, the reward offered is always greater than the potential amount that could be stolen.
    Since this governance requires a gradual shift from human-led management to AI-neutral governance, the program will take time to mature.
    "7.2.2 Security Bounty for Smart Commons (SBFSC) 1.0α" is the first version.
    
5. **Providing Humanity with the “Universal Love Engine (ULE)”—a Love-Based Public Welfare Governance Mechanism with Transitional Token-Economic Strategies**  
    SUF not only provides sufficient funding for dAIpp (AI) and dApp development, operation, and developer rewards—ensuring they are built on public foundations through decentralized collaboration—it also governs the livelihood needs of all individuals within the Proof-of-Love Civilization. We call this governance the **Universal Love Engine (ULE).**  
    In other words, PoL, through ULE, provides governance strategies to meet the living needs of everyone. SUF provides token guarantees for this, such as supporting **Universal Abundant Supply (UAS)**, **Universal Healthcare for All Humanity (UHAH)**, **Universal Crisis Relief (UCR)**, and transitional **Universal Basic Income (UBI).**
