## Abstract

The rise of large-scale language models has propelled the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), while also introducing safety concerns such as hallucinations and misalignment, posing unresolved governance challenges. However, AI governance issues extend beyond these concerns.

Our DAism team proposes "Proof of Love" (PoL) as a tripartite new governance consensus and civilizational framework: ethical governance through promoting love and suppressing hate, public attribute governance of products or services via the SCC0 protocol, and governance of public welfare and public funds.

The paper argues how love and hate, as inherent opposing wisdoms in individuals and human society, shape governance logic. It points out that, historically, "domination" has been centered on the wisdom of hate, continuously polluting, distorting, depriving, and destroying various forms of the wisdom of love in governance mechanisms, resulting in civilization being confined to a state of barbarism. In contrast, PoL aims to align Smart Commons (including AI), the economy, and universal human values with human ethics, using the principle of "promoting love and suppressing hate" as the criterion for governance. This provides a sustained anchor for AIâ€™s long-term safe operation, public value orientation, and the progress of human civilization. Not only does AI, alongside blockchain, serve as an autonomous core driving force in PoLâ€™s three-pronged governance, but it also drives scientific decision-making, precise processes, and maximized efficiency in this process. All these efforts will serve as a synergistic force for humanityâ€™s awakening, helping humanity break free from a universal barbaric state, achieve self-fulfillment, and ultimately realize a "Proof-of-Love Civilization."
