## Abstract

The rise of large-scale language models has propelled the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), while also introducing safety concerns such as hallucinations and misalignment, posing unresolved governance challenges. However, AI governance issues extend beyond these concerns.

Our DAism team proposes "Proof of Love" (PoL) as a tripartite new governance consensus and civilizational framework: ethical alignment governance through promoting love and suppressing hate, public attribute governance of products or services via the SCC0 License developed with smart contract technology, and governance of public welfare and public funds.

The paper argues how love and hate, as inherent opposing wisdoms in individuals and human society, shape governance logic. It points out that the longstanding practice of governing human society, "domination", deeply entrenched in various aspects, is fundamentally rooted in the wisdom of hate. This governance mechanism continuously pollutes, corrupts, and deprives the wisdom of love in its many forms, thereby confining civilization to a state of barbarism. In contrast, PoL aims to align Smart Commons (including AI), the economy, and universal human values with human ethics, using the principle of "promoting love and suppressing hate" as the criterion for governance. This provides a sustained anchor for AI’s long-term safe operation, public value orientation, and the progress of human civilization. Not only does AI (human collective wisdom), alongside blockchain, serve as an autonomous driving hub in PoL’s three-pronged governance, but it also drives scientific decision-making, precise processes, and maximized efficiency in this process. All these efforts will serve as a synergistic force for humanity’s awakening, helping humanity break free from a universal barbaric state, achieve self-fulfillment, and ultimately realize a Proof-of-Love Civilization.
