# 3. The Convergence of Domination and Barbarism: Power as the Root of Hatred, Alienation, and Obstacles to Civilizational Development

This section aims to explore in depth the thesis that “domination is the social root of hatred and barbarism.” We will examine the fundamental link between hierarchical power structures and destructive human behavior as well as social stagnation. The analysis will systematically address how various forms of political, economic, social, and cultural power generate hatred, strip and instrumentalize love in human relationships, and ultimately obstruct genuine civilizational progress. Drawing on critical social theory, Marxist analysis, Foucauldian perspectives, and contemporary psychology and sociology, we will reveal how domination, beneath the veneer of modern progress, perpetuates—and even deepens—a condition of “primordial barbarism.”

Yes, this also means that human society still exists in a half-barbaric, half-civilized state.

## 3.1 Hatred, Barbaric Behavior, and Domination

According to Wikipedia, hatred is a strong negative emotional reaction toward certain people, things, or ideas, often linked to opposition or disgust. Hatred is frequently associated with intense anger, contempt, and revulsion, and is sometimes regarded as the opposite of love.

Hatred is a latent, object-directed negative emotional experience that can be externalized as aggression, insults, deception, contempt, or discrimination against others (or oneself), or internalized as anger, sadness, despair, disappointment, or loathing.

It is both an inner emotional state and a process whereby individuals or collective organizations incite and translate this emotion into violent thoughts and actions. Rooted in zero-sum “life-or-death” dualism, hatred manifests in verbal assault, institutionalized discrimination, social exclusion, and violent practices. These not only erode trust and public cooperation, jeopardizing the physical and psychological well-being of others, but also backfire on perpetrators, leading to self-barbarization and cycles of inner torment.

The origins of hatred are evolutionarily intelligible: lions need prey, boar piglets need protection. In the jungle, facing food scarcity or predators, there is no space for love—only extreme hatred ensures survival. For humans, responding to barbaric assault often necessitates barbaric retaliation to defend oneself or others—what we term legitimate self-defense. Indeed, hatred can sometimes serve crucial self-protective or altruistic functions. However, since legitimate self-defense entails a complex blend of love and hate, it will not be the focus here.

Triggers of Hatred:

- Negative judgments and emotional projection

- Cognitive distortions (e.g., labor alienation)

- Power struggles and domination mechanisms

- Survival threats or selfish motives

Externalization of Hatred:

- Verbal aggression, insult, and discrimination

- Institutional injustice and social exclusion

- Violence and barbaric practices

- Information manipulation and propagandistic incitement

Social Consequences:

- Erosion of social trust and public cooperation

- Reinforcement of “us–them” antagonisms, ritualizing collective hatred

- Intensification of structural inequality and cycles of conflict

Self-Impact:

- Self-barbarization: loss of empathy, magnified violent impulses, pride in being “powerful” or “ruthless”

- Self-torment: cycles of anxiety, guilt, or narcissism, oscillating between “I am unworthy of love” and “everyone must love me”

Among children and adolescents, school bullying, exclusion, or chronic stress often translate suppressed hatred into depression, anxiety, and other mental health challenges—typical expressions of these mechanisms among vulnerable groups.

Hatred can be fleeting or enduring. Its intensity ranges from mild dislike (“I hate broccoli”) to global nihilism (“I hate the entire world”). In some cases, hatred is a learned response shaped by abuse, manipulation, or indoctrination.

If we define barbaric behavior as any deliberate act that inflicts harm, oppression, or deprivation upon one’s own or others’ life, dignity, freedom, ecology, or spirit—then we see clearly that such intentional harm requires the presence of deep negative emotions toward its target. Except in cases of specific mental illness, hatred—manifesting as loathing, fear, prejudice, discrimination, deceit, or envy—provides the core psychological fuel for barbarism. Its ultimate effect is to damage, or even sever, the bonds of love and trust between human beings and between humans and nature.

In this sense, hatred supplies the emotional justification (“they deserve punishment”), while barbaric behavior supplies the practical means (exclusion, online mobbing, torture, massacre, discriminatory laws).

Thus, hatred is the central psychological driver of barbaric action. In other words, behaviors motivated by hatred are inherently barbaric rather than civilized.

Since we have already defined acts of love as Love Languages, we now introduce the counterpart: acts of hatred and barbarism as Hate Languages. For brevity, we also use “hate” to refer to this category.

Hate is a negative emotional experience constructed through human cognition and practice, often externalized into harmful behaviors.

In this paper, we focus specifically on hate languages expressed through hateful and barbaric acts.

Domination refers to the exercise of control by a minority or an individual, through power structures, over the life, will, property, and autonomy of others. It directly violates others’ “freedom” and “dignity,” and entails oppression and exploitation of the majority. It is, therefore, itself a form of barbarism. Prejudice, discrimination, hatred, fear, and the thirst for power are often legitimized and institutionalized within relations of domination. Where domination becomes normalized, other barbarisms—torture, enslavement, systemic oppression—follow as its subordinate forms.

“The essence of politics is power, not morality.” So warned Niccolò Machiavelli in The Prince. Similarly, over 1,800 years earlier, Shang Yang in The Book of Lord Shang offered parallel insights. If domination is not rooted in morality, then its essence is—as Lu Xun wrote in Diary of a Madman—to eat people.

Domination permeates all realms of human society: from states to families, from politics to economics, from corporations to schools. Its ubiquity multiplies its harms. If domination invariably produces barbarism, then hatred is its underlying driver—this is no exaggeration.

As the U.S. Declaration of Independence (1776) proclaimed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” Yet 248 years later, one need only examine the actions of the Trump administration to ask: which of these inalienable rights were truly safeguarded under its rule?

Of course, this indictment applies not only to Trump but to rulers in general.

Structures of Power in Contemporary Human Domination

Political Power Structures:

- International organizations (UN, WTO, IEA, WHO, UNESCO) shaping sovereignty, trade, energy, health, culture, and education.

- Nation-states and government branches (legislative, executive, judicial).

- Military and police (monopoly on legitimate violence).

- Bureaucracies (vast civil service systems).

Economic Power Structures:

- Capital (Marx’s “silent force”).

- Multinational corporations and monopolistic conglomerates.

- Financial institutions (banks, private equity, hedge funds).

Cultural and Ideological Power Structures:

- Mainstream media and opinion-shaping machinery.

- Educational systems (curricula, classrooms, examinations).

- Religion and ideological organizations.

Technological and Informational Power Structures:

- Tech giants and platforms (algorithmic recommendation, data control).

- Surveillance and security networks (digital monitoring, big-data analysis).

Social and Group Power Structures:

- Elite networks and exclusive clubs.

- Families and kinship systems (mutual aid and exclusion based on bloodline or locality).

- Professional and industry associations (certifications, standards, regulations).

Familial and Intimate Power Structures:

- Household authority hierarchies: parental control over children or spousal domination based on tradition, economics, or emotional dependency.

- Patriarchal/clan systems legitimizing absolute seniority.

- Invisible domination in intimate relationships (emotional blackmail, financial control, information blocking).

Legal and Institutional Power Structures:

- Legal texts and judicial interpretations (defining “legal/illegal”).

- Regulatory and compliance systems (licensing, censorship, sanctions).

These structures intersect to form a multi-dimensional domination network linking ruling elites, privileged classes, and vested interests into an entrenched alliance. Thus, any discussion of human governance must necessarily address domination and power in depth.

## 3.2 Theoretical Foundations of Power and Oppression
### 3.2.1 Critical Theory: Systemic, Disciplinary, and Ideological Dimensions of Power

Critical theory, originating from the Frankfurt School, is a current of social, historical, and political thought whose core lies in analyzing and challenging systemic power relations in society. Unlike traditional social theory, which aims to describe and understand society, critical theory explicitly seeks to critique and transform it, emphasizing the unity of theory and praxis. It maintains that knowledge, truth, and social structures are fundamentally shaped by the dynamics between ruling and oppressed groups.

Modern critical theory goes beyond Marxism’s purely economic analysis by incorporating and reworking Freudian concepts and postmodernist perspectives to examine broader cultural and social structures of power. Its goal is to “liberate human beings from the circumstances that enslave them,” often achieved through “immanent critique” of a society’s own proclaimed values. Paulo Freire’s Pedagogy of the Oppressed is a seminal contribution, framing the classroom as a microcosm of society that reflects the dialectical relationship between oppressors and the oppressed, thereby offering practical routes for social critique.

This transition from purely economic analysis to cultural and psychological examination highlights that domination is no longer limited to material control but extends into the manipulation of desires, cognition, and identity. If domination is a form of “primordial barbarism,” then its manifestations are not only naked coercion or economic compulsion but also subtle, pervasive forms of enslavement. This expanded definition of barbarism encompasses the systematic dehumanization of individuals through cultural and psychological means and the erosion of autonomy—domination as control of the human subject itself, not merely the body.

### 3.2.2 Marxist Perspectives: Exploitation, Alienation, and Class Domination

From a Marxist standpoint, social power and coercion are exercised through economic exploitation. Workers are exploited because they cannot retain or control the full value of their labor, while capitalists appropriate the surplus. The inherently exploitative nature of capitalism implies that nearly every exchange carries the potential for exploitation.

In this process, poverty is not naturally occurring but is “first manufactured by the capitalist system, and only later addressed as a problem to be solved.” Redistribution by the state is thus a secondary remedy imposed upon primary inequality created by initial distribution. This institutionalized exploitation forms the essence of capitalist economic relations.

Alienation (Entfremdung) and reification are key concepts in critical theory, rooted in Marxist analysis.

“The relation of the worker to the product of his labor is as to an alien object… The more the worker expends himself in labor, the more powerful becomes the alien world of objects he creates against himself, the poorer he becomes in his inner life, and the less he belongs to himself.”

Here Marx reveals how human “species-being” is alienated into independent capital that, once crystallized, dominates the very individuals who created it. Alienation manifests as loss of confidence in one’s environment and in oneself, leading to profound loneliness and despair. Its expressions include powerlessness (lack of control over working conditions), meaninglessness (disconnection from larger purposes), isolation (absence of belonging), and self-alienation (discontent with one’s own work).

Reification transforms social relations into relations between things, reducing individuals to mere “cogs in the machine.” For the bourgeoisie, alienation is perversely experienced as confirmation of their own power; they embrace alienation as strength, while simultaneously intensifying their cruelty toward workers.

Marxist state theory holds that the state is a machine for maintaining class domination: an organization of the ruling class endowed with the strongest instruments of repression and coercion. In capitalism, the state is structured to uphold capitalist institutions and ensure the dictatorship of a minority of capitalists through both violent and ideological apparatuses.

The Marxist concept of reification—social relations treated as relations between objects—combined with the idea of objectified labor becoming a dominating force, reveals the subtle but profound instrumentality inherent in capitalist structures. Human agency paradoxically creates alienated powers (capital/objectified labor) that turn back upon their creators, exploiting and ruling them. This “systemic instrumentalization” extends beyond interpersonal exploitation to the very level of social structure, reducing individuals to components within an impersonal economic machine. This, too, is a form of barbarism.

### 3.2.3 Foucauldian Insights: Power Beyond the State, Normalization, and Biopower

Michel Foucault rejected the notion that power resides solely in the state, arguing instead that power has a broader, more diffuse basis, embedded in complex networks of relationships between individuals. The modern state, in his view, is a sophisticated structure that integrates individuals into its order by conditioning them to adopt certain patterns and forms of individuality, thereby exercising control over them.

Foucault distinguished between sovereign power (judicial, prohibitive—the “sword of sovereignty”) and disciplinary power. Disciplinary power is a productive force that operates through normalization, prescribing possible actions for subjects, rewarding conformity, and punishing deviation. Punishment shifts from revealing truth to producing docile, rule-following subjects.

This new power form, biopower, is productive and life-oriented, managing populations in ways essential to capitalism, since it aligns human life with economic processes.

Foucault also emphasized: “Where there is power, there is resistance.” Power does not act upon inert bodies; subjects respond and transform commands in multiple ways. Power binds subjects to their identities, making them internalize norms as if they were their own, so that they become simultaneously the targets and carriers of power.

The distinction between sovereign and disciplinary power reveals that modern domination is not crude repression but subtle, internalized control—shaping identity and behavior, making resistance far more difficult. This represents a more insidious form of barbarism, one that hijacks freedom itself to create self-replicating mechanisms of domination. Individuals reproduce the very norms that enslave them, even under the illusion of being “free.”

### 3.2.4 Power, Privilege, and Oppression in Social Structures

Power is the capacity to influence others and make decisions. Privilege refers to unearned advantages conferred by membership in a dominant group. Oppression is power exercised over time in ways that systematically disadvantage another group. Even when interpersonal relations seem harmonious, structural disadvantage persists because it is sustained by institutions—policies, governments, educational systems, healthcare—and reinforced by social norms.

Inequitable distribution of power produces discrimination and injustice, rooted both in individual prejudice and in systemic bias. These unjust systems span contexts from corporate boardrooms to university admissions, consistently reproducing hierarchical and elitist outcomes.

Social Dominance Theory explains how stable societies form hierarchies along axes such as race, gender, religion, and class, wherein dominant groups enjoy privilege while subordinate groups endure disadvantage. These hierarchies are sustained not by constant coercion but by “legitimizing myths”—widely accepted cultural ideologies that naturalize inequality.

Such myths reveal that power structures not only impose disadvantage but normalize and rationalize it through broadly accepted yet rarely scrutinized beliefs. This links directly to concepts of false consciousness and epistemic ideology. Legitimizing myths are cultural ideologies based on stereotypes—overgeneralized beliefs about particular groups—that are then used to justify domination in seemingly “culturally acceptable” ways.

False consciousness describes how dominant institutions disseminate “counterfactual but normative assumptions and rituals” that make exploitation less visible or more palatable. Epistemic ideology refers to flawed cultural systems of understanding that empower elites.

The causal chain is clear: dominant groups create and propagate these myths/ideologies, which then solidify into “common sense.” This ideological manipulation constitutes a profound form of “primordial barbarism,” because it undermines critical thought and collective resistance, perpetuating oppression without overt coercion.

## 3.3 The Origins of Hatred in Power Structures
### 3.3.1 Mechanisms by Which Power Imbalances Breed Hostility and Conflict

Hatred, fear, and contempt are the emotions that drive conflict participants toward violence; they replace reason with fictitious notions of the “dangerous Other.” Hatred is a deep and extreme emotional aversion, typically associated with hostility toward its target, and can escalate to violent acts such as murder and war.

The exercise of power can induce, motivate, entice, coerce, or overwhelm conflict participants. This form of “emotional power” reflects the integration of power dynamics and emotional life, manifested in public performances of gathering, debating, deliberating, cheering, jeering, or even fighting. Over time, repeated exposure to such power can “train” or “condition” individuals to respond in specific ways.

Emotional power—defined as the integration of power dynamics with emotional life—shows that hatred is not merely an individual feeling but also a form of social engineering employed by ruling powers to mobilize conflict participants and control target populations, making it a direct tool of barbarism. Emotional power has been defined as a “socio-psychological force that interacts with conflict dynamics” and can “induce, motivate, entice, coerce, or overwhelm conflict participants.” A particularly insidious form of this power is state-driven campaigns aimed at controlling the thoughts and lives of targeted groups by instilling a sense of inferiority.

This establishes a direct causal chain: power structures actively cultivate and exploit emotions such as hatred, transforming them from private feelings into collective destructive forces. The systematic manipulation of emotions for the purposes of control and violence is a clear expression of “primordial barbarism,” revealing that hatred is not simply a spontaneous eruption but a deliberate product of domination.

### 3.3.2 Psychological Dimension: Devaluing Victims and Instilling Inferiority

Hatred rests on a complex mix of cognition and emotion. Its cognitive component involves devaluing the “Other” and perceiving them as a threat. Hate-based violence is driven by persistent, negative cognitions toward the “Other” and the intent to harm or destroy them.

Systematic humiliation is a key mechanism of state power, exploiting the psychology of targeted groups by inducing “toxic self-deprecation” to erode self-esteem. This works by fabricating images of incompetence or worthlessness, generating both external and internalized devaluation, making these groups less likely to resist authority.

As hatred grows, targets are stripped of moral or human consideration, creating a sense of legitimacy for action—even annihilation—against them. This process erodes empathy.

The twin mechanisms of victim devaluation and systematic humiliation through instilled inferiority represent a form of psychological warfare deployed by power structures. Dehumanization erodes empathy and legitimizes violence, directly enabling barbarism by dismantling moral restraints. Hatred, characterized by “an increasing need to devalue victims,” inevitably “reduces empathy.” Meanwhile, systematic humiliation as a form of state power instills “toxic self-deprecation” that weakens targets’ self-esteem and makes them “less likely to complain, obstruct, resist, or rebel against authority.”

The logical implication is that by systematically stripping individuals or groups of basic humanity and value, ruling powers eliminate moral and psychological barriers to harm. Hatred then becomes the justification—“the reason to act, even to annihilate the hated Other.” This reveals the direct and sinister causal pathway from power-induced psychological manipulation to violence and barbaric behavior, showing how domination actively cultivates the conditions for hatred and cruelty.

### 3.3.3 Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) and Its Association with Reduced Empathy Toward Outgroups

Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) measures an individual’s preference for and endorsement of group-based social hierarchies and inequality. It is associated with competitive worldviews and heightened prejudicial attitudes.

High levels of SDO are consistently correlated with lower empathy and higher “counter-empathy” (taking pleasure in others’ suffering, or schadenfreude). This reduction in empathy is most pronounced toward outgroup members, especially under competitive or threatening intergroup conditions.

Importantly, efforts toward social equality and inclusion can paradoxically amplify the effects of authoritarianism (closely related to SDO) on prejudice, as authoritarians perceive such equality as a “situational threat.”

That SDO can reinforce prejudice even in egalitarian contexts demonstrates that the drive for domination actively undermines attempts to build a more equal society. Progress toward equality is reinterpreted as a threat to hierarchical preferences, triggering intensified prejudice and hatred. Research shows that “social equality and inclusion strengthen the impact of authoritarianism on prejudice. These results suggest that equality functions as a situational threat, catalyzing ‘authoritarian dynamics’ rather than being embraced as a norm by authoritarians.”

This reveals a profound causal mechanism: dominance-oriented individuals not only thrive under systems of inequality but also actively resist and distort egalitarian efforts. When confronted with conditions that challenge hierarchical preferences, they may respond with heightened prejudice and hatred, perceiving inclusionary measures as existential threats to their status. This illustrates how domination perpetuates “primordial barbarism,” converting positive social progress into triggers for conflict and hostility.

| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Systematic Humiliation**              | State Power                          | Devaluation, instillation of inferiority     | Violence, discrimination, social exclusion     |

| **Group Division / Competition**        | Social Power                         | Reduced empathy, schadenfreude               | Prejudice, social exclusion                    |

| **International Sanctions / Isolation** | Power of International Organizations | Collective suffering, externalized hostility | Xenophobia, nationalist mobilization           |

## 3.4 The Deprivation and Instrumentalization of Love and Human Relationships
### 3.4.1 The Impact of Unequal Power Dynamics on Interpersonal Bonds and Empathy

Power and control dynamics significantly shape interpersonal relationships, influencing interactions and well-being. In imbalanced relationships, the dominant partner may find it difficult to generate empathy, shifting focus from understanding the partner’s perspective to maintaining control. This can result in emotional manipulation, gaslighting, verbal abuse, financial control, isolation, threats, and micromanagement.

Empathy is foundational to the development and maintenance of human relationships. While empathy usually fosters social affinity and warmth, it may be undermined if it interferes with competition or is exploited to understand more powerful others for status gains.

High relational power can lead individuals to believe they lose less if the relationship dissolves. Studies show that those perceiving themselves as holding higher power in relationships are more prone to attraction to alternatives outside the relationship, engaging in fantasies or romantic interactions with substitute partners. This phenomenon is mediated by an increased perception of one’s own “mate value.”

Thus, when high-power partners perceive themselves as more attractive and at lower risk of loss, they are more likely to disengage from existing commitments and seek alternatives. This creates systematic “love deprivation” for lower-power partners, whose emotional needs and fundamental commitments are undermined by power imbalance. Domination—even in intimate settings—therefore manifests as a relational form of barbarism.

### 3.4.2 Buber’s “I-It” Relationship: Objectification and Instrumental Treatment of Others

Martin Buber’s I and Thou distinguishes two fundamental relational modes: “I-It” and “I-You.”

The “I-It” relation is based on alienation, where the other is treated as an object or instrument for utility. Here, the “I” emerges as a self-conscious subject of experience and use.

By contrast, the “I-You” relation entails openness, ethical engagement, and recognition of the other’s intrinsic worth, characterized by dialogue and full presence.

Rick Bellingham interprets “I-It” as “aggressive power abuse,” in which one person views another as an object to be exploited, linking it with predatory behaviors.

Buber’s concept of the “I-It” relation provides a philosophical articulation of human instrumentalization inherent in power structures. It is a precursor to aggressive power abuse that denies the dignity and subjectivity of others. The shift from recognizing others as “You” to treating them as “It” constitutes a fundamental dehumanization, paving the way for exploitation and abuse. This dynamic reveals how instrumentalization is not only an outcome of power but also a core mechanism of barbarism in human relationships, corroding the very foundation of human connection.

### 3.4.3 Romantic Love as a Biological Drive and the Consequences of Misunderstanding/Repression

One study argues that Romantic Love is a primary biological drive, akin to hunger or thirst, rather than an emotion. This widespread misunderstanding, entrenched by science and society, has severe consequences.

Sexual control is regarded as a major source and expression of power in many species, including humans. Religion and society have historically exploited institutionalized marriage to manufacture a “false and coerced state of love,” enforcing exclusivity in unions driven primarily by sexual interest, while punishing deviations.

The repression and distortion of romantic love as a biological drive—through sexual control and institutionalized marriage—results in “love deprivation syndromes” and severe outcomes such as relationship breakdown, divorce, suicide, and femicide. This demonstrates how domination actively corrupts a core human need, transforming a life-affirming force into a source of profound suffering and violence.

### 3.4.4 Authoritarian Structures (e.g., Parenting Styles) and Their Impact on Emotional Well-being and Genuine Connection

Authoritarian parenting, characterized by high demands and low emotional warmth, is linked to adverse outcomes in children’s emotional and psychological development. Children raised in such environments show lower psychological well-being, poorer emotion regulation, and greater reliance on suppression strategies rather than reappraisal.

Emotional suppression carries social costs: reduced social support, diminished intimacy, and lower satisfaction in relationships. It disrupts emotional communication and undermines authenticity.

Adolescents with authoritarian tendencies show weaker cognitive abilities and emotional intelligence. Individuals with lower intelligence may be more drawn to authoritarianism due to a preference for simplistic solutions. Authoritarian parenting often cultivates authoritarian traits in children.

This causal chain demonstrates that domination—even within the family—actively undermines authentic emotional expression and connection, perpetuating intergenerational deprivation of love. Authoritarian structures erode the capacity for genuine relationships, embedding a subtle but widespread form of barbarism at the most fundamental social unit.

### 3.4.5 Necropolitics: The Ultimate Instrumentalization of Human Life by States

Achille Mbembe’s concept of necropolitics refers to state power exercised through the regulation and manipulation of death—determining whose lives are disposable and whose are protected. It is the “power of death over life.”

This excludes marginalized groups from power, rendering them targets for elimination. Human bodies are instrumentalized: either used for state purposes or discarded as worthless in pursuit of “higher national goals.”

The concept of bare life (homo sacer) describes those outside the political community who may be killed without consequence, excluded from legal protection.

Necropolitics represents the ultimate form of human instrumentalization, where dominant power structures not only control but actively determine the expendability of populations. It is barbarism in its most extreme form, denying the sanctity and dignity of human life. The Holocaust stands as a paradigmatic case, though history is replete with similar atrocities.

## 3.5 Domination as an Obstacle to Civilizational Development
Material-Centric Civilizational Critique: Neglect of Morality and Justice

Prevailing (Western) notions of civilization, Eurocentric in orientation, emphasize institutions, economics, democracy, and technological progress, while neglecting morality, ethics, and justice.

A nation may achieve high levels of material advancement yet act with cruelty and oppression—through deceit, exploitation, injustice domestically, or imperialist aggression abroad. Such a society may conduct wars of conquest, plunder, and destruction reminiscent of barbaric tribes.

This critique reveals that material progress divorced from ethics perpetuates cycles of uncivilized and destructive behavior. Darwinian-inspired Western worldviews, described as animalistic, racist, and bellicose, cannot serve as the model for human civilization.

How Power Structures Hinder Human Flourishing and Ethical Progress

Domination and existing social structures obstruct self-acceptance by stigmatizing and marginalizing those who deviate from enforced norms. They impose barriers to autonomy and agency, preventing individuals from acting according to their circumstances.

They foster moral blind spots (failure to perceive moral aspects of situations) and ethical fading (self-deceptive rationalization that intentions are good). They enforce “adaptive preferences,” where individuals adjust desires downward to limited circumstances, blocking the pursuit of higher goals.

Thus, domination subtly internalizes oppression, conditioning individuals to accept constraints and overlook ethical issues. This prevents critical reflection and collective action, undermining the moral evolution necessary for civilizational progress.

Social Control Mechanisms

- Bread and Circuses:
Originating from Juvenal, this refers to appeasing the populace with food and entertainment to divert attention from deeper social problems. In modern contexts, it manifests through consumerism, shallow incentives, and mass distraction, linked to the “dominant ideology” ensuring disadvantaged classes accept their fate.

- Consumerism:
As Zygmunt Bauman argues, under “liquid modernity,” consumption has become an obligation, not a choice. Freedom and happiness are equated with consumption. Those unable to fully participate become “defective consumers,” excluded from social life. This commodification of control diverts energy from ethical and civilizational development, locking individuals into cycles of acquisition rather than collective flourishing.

- Digital Distraction:
Social media platforms, designed for engagement, amplify misinformation, consume cognitive resources, and suppress critical thinking. As modern “bread and circuses,” they create systemic distraction, weakening democratic deliberation and blocking civilizational progress.

The Role of Military, Police, and Technological Power in Preserving the Status Quo

- Military-Industrial Complex (MIC):
The entanglement of military and defense industries creates vested interests that institutionalize conflict and divert resources from civilizational progress, a highly organized form of barbarism.

- Police Militarization:
Law enforcement adoption of military-grade equipment and tactics fosters intimidation, erodes trust, and disproportionately targets marginalized groups. This domestic application of force undermines social cohesion and reveals internalized barbarism.

- Big Tech and Information Power:
Tech giants monopolize infrastructure, data, and generative AI, redefining communication, commerce, and policy-making. As “gatekeepers of knowledge,” they centralize power, distort narratives, and threaten democratic processes, obstructing rational collective decision-making essential for civilizational advancement.

- Bureaucracy:
Max Weber’s “iron cage” critique remains relevant: bureaucratic systems prioritize efficiency and calculability at the expense of freedom and meaning. As Habermas argues, technocratic administration replaces deliberation, producing “communicative poverty” and alienation, suppressing democratic vitality.

- Authoritarianism:
Authoritarian regimes consolidate unilateral control, suppress bottom-up initiatives, and encourage preference falsification. By replacing trust and collaboration with fear and coercion, authoritarianism systematically undermines social cohesion, obstructing the collaborative development essential for civilization.

## 3.6 The Many Ways Domination Corrupts Love

History shows that through the ten “languages of love” we summarized earlier, domination employs various methods of destruction: pollution, distortion, deprivation, counterfeiting, and outright annihilation.

### 3.6.1 Words of Affirmation — The Magic of Language

Example: During the height of the Great Terror (1937–1938), the Soviet regime distributed rewards as lavishly as punishments. Internal NKVD reports indicate that more than 1,200 officers received the Order of the Red Banner for “loyal service,” often directly tied to their participation in mass arrests and executions.

Surface: Public commendation of “loyal party members” or soldiers, praised as “the most lovable people.”

Substance: These rewards were directly linked to mass arrests and killings, where “praise” masked fear, encouraging denunciations and betrayals. Commendation became the spark for purges, destroying comradeship and trust.

Analysis: Words of affirmation were twisted into tools of betrayal and barbarity, revealing domination’s methods of pollution and counterfeit love.

### 3.6.2 Quality Time — The Warmth of Shared Moments

Example: Nazi Germany’s “Youth Camps.”

Surface: Hitler Youth organized outdoor activities, camps, and training that appeared to promote collective spirit.

Substance: Amidst shared “joyful times,” hatred was implanted. Racist indoctrination was disguised as “unity and belonging,” with boys being taught to despise outsiders.

Analysis: Shared time was distorted into an instrument of indoctrination, demonstrating domination’s method of twisting warmth into hatred.

### 3.6.3 Receiving Gifts — The Heart of Reciprocity

Example: The Samsung–Park Geun-hye corruption scandal (2016–2017). Samsung’s leader, Lee Jae-yong, provided KRW 43 billion (~USD 36.4 million) to Choi Soon-sil’s foundations, along with horses and financial support for her daughter’s equestrian career. The case led to Park Geun-hye’s impeachment, a 20-year prison sentence, and fines.

Surface: In Korean culture, gift-giving symbolizes respect, gratitude, or personal ties.

Substance: In reality, the gifts were bribes for government support of corporate mergers. Though convicted, Lee Jae-yong was pardoned early, and Samsung’s operations were largely unaffected.

Analysis: The love-language of gifting was corrupted into a tool of systemic corruption and domination.

### 3.6.4 Acts of Service — The Love of Selfless Giving

Example: The Khmer Rouge’s “Mass Labor” campaigns (1975–1979).

Surface: Everyone contributing to an egalitarian society through steel-making and irrigation.

Substance: Millions perished from starvation and exhaustion. Service was wholly alienated into a machine of dehumanization.

Analysis: Service, instead of love, became sheer destruction—labor turned into extermination.

### 3.6.5 Physical Touch — The Elevation of Bodily Contact

Example: Romania’s Decree 770 (1960s), banning abortion and enforcing pro-natalist policy.

Surface: Families were required to have four or more children, with orphans raised by the state.

Substance: Orphanages were severely under-resourced, with one caregiver for 40 infants. The lack of physical contact led to underdeveloped hippocampi, cognitive deficits, self-harm, epilepsy, and mortality rates as high as 153‰ in some institutions.

Analysis: The deprivation of touch demonstrates how domination mutilates the most basic channel of love.

### 3.6.6 Self-Love — Embracing One’s Own Value

Example: The Nazi regime’s gradual stripping of Jewish selfhood. From the Nuremberg Laws onward, Jews were denied citizenship, barred from professions, schools, hospitals, and forced into ghettos and camps.

Self-love, the foundation of loving others, was systematically destroyed. Jews were forced to accept identities of inferiority and unworthiness, eroding their ability to love themselves.

Victor Frankl noted that prisoners’ spiritual survival depended on hope; once hope was lost, defeat was inevitable. Yet, the deeper truth is that the regime’s primary tool was to annihilate self-love itself, breaking people from within.

### 3.6.7 Empathy — The Spirit of Agape

Example: British colonial “civilizing mission.”

Surface: Bringing Christianity and education, claiming empathy for “backward natives.”

Substance: In reality, this masked dispossession of land and culture, a genocidal assimilation cloaked as benevolence.

Analysis: Hatred disguised as empathy; extermination through counterfeit love.

### 3.6.8 Romantic Love — The Highest Experience of Body and Spirit

Example: As of the 2020s, ~20 countries and 16 U.S. states (plus Puerto Rico) still criminalize adultery.

Surface: Upholding morality or religious norms.

Substance: Such laws suppress the freedom of romantic expression, often targeting women, even punishing rape victims if they cannot “prove” innocence.

Analysis: Romantic love is subordinated to state and religious control, stripped of privacy and autonomy.

### 3.6.9 Love of Resonant Carriers — Shared Expression of Emotion

Example: Nazi persecution of homosexuals under Section 175.

Mechanisms:

Legal violence: arrests, imprisonment, exclusion.

Propaganda: media portraying homosexuals as “degenerates.”

Social exclusion: public denunciation campaigns.

Impact: Denied the right to express love publicly, forced underground, lives endangered. Carriers of resonance (texts, media, schools) became tools of destruction rather than connection.

### 3.6.10 Cross-Species Empathy — Love Extending to All Life

Example: Nazi “animal protection laws.”

Surface: Strict animal welfare legislation.

Substance: While protecting animals, the regime exterminated Jews and Roma. Hatred was masked as “love for pure life,” while ecological destruction from war was ignored.

### 3.6.11 Cosmic Love — Humanity’s Bond with the Stars

Example: The U.S.–Soviet Space Race during the Cold War.

Surface: Framed as humanity’s shared aspiration for the cosmos.

Substance: In reality, a competition of military technologies, polluting cosmic love with nationalism and arms race logic.

Summary: These cases show how rulers corrupt the languages of love—polluting, disguising, or reversing them—turning humanity’s deepest bonds into instruments of fear, hatred, and extermination.

## 3.7 The Alienation of “Love” by Rulers and the Politics of Fear

Rulers, though human and needing love, often sacrifice genuine love for power. They adopt predatory strategies:

### 3.7.1 “Affluence Motivation” in Scarcity Eras: Leaders who amassed resources gained survival and legitimacy.

### 3.7.2 “Predatory Strategies and Reproductive Advantage”: Polygamy, concubinage, monopolization of partners—short-term reproductive gain, long-term social destabilization.

### 3.7.3 Emotional Predation and Self-Alienation: Rulers manufacture chains of fear and dependence, mistaking submission for loyalty, while losing their own capacity for self-love.

Core Insight: Barbaric acts primarily aim to generate fear and intimidation:

- Suppressing resistance

- Isolating victims

- Dividing alliances

- Gaining control

Domination’s central function is exchanging fear for obedience. Only by recognizing this can we counter it with the courage of a love-rich civilization, transforming fear into solidarity, support, and truth.

## 3.8 Indifference to the Privilege of Domination and the State of Civilization

Domination emerged historically as a mechanism for cooperation, resource management, and social security. Yet its maintenance has always relied on violence driven by hate—not love.

Our analysis demonstrates: domination is the root of hatred and primitive barbarism. From Marx’s critique of systemic exploitation, to Foucault’s normalization of obedient subjects, to the necropolitics of expendable lives—power actively produces the conditions for hatred and dehumanization.

But unlike the flourishing of natural sciences, the critical study of domination (Hobbes, Marx, etc.) has stagnated. Modern society normalizes skyscrapers like the Burj Khalifa, forgetting that they—like the Pyramids—symbolize domination and inequality. Many today insist that barbarism is only an exception, or that “civilization” is relative.

Yet data from the Global Peace Index 2025 shows otherwise:

Global peace at its lowest since records began.

59 active state-based conflicts, the most since WWII.

152,000 conflict-related deaths in 2024.

17 countries with >1,000 deaths, the highest since 1999.

Violence cost USD 19.97 trillion in 2024 (11.6% of global GDP).

Conclusion: Humanity is at a crossroads. AI development will liberate humans from the prison of labor, offering a pivotal opportunity for new governance systems. Recognizing domination as the root of hatred and barbarism is the first step toward designing a civilization of affluent love.
